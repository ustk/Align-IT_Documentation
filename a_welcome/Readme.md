### Welcome to Align-IT!

Thank you for choosing Studio 427 Audio.  
Here you will find the information necessary for measuring the delay times of your speakers, and optimise your venue.

### What is Align-IT?

Align-IT is a measurement tool that will compute the delay of your different speakers regarding to a reference. These delays can then be reported to the PA processors accordingly.

It is as simple as connecting a microphone, record the different speakers, and wait for Align-IT to compute the resulting delays.

Align-IT also provides a complete frequency spectrum analyser, with collections to memorise your system responses.

There are many tools on the market for achieving the calibration of a venue. Although, most of the time you only want a quick and affordalble solution for a simple calculation of the delays and a spectogram visualisation. Align-IT is made for you in the situations where time and simplicity are key factors.

### What Align-IT proposes:

- Record and compute delay times between speakers.
- Spectral visualisation.
- 3 types of noise generated to adapt to any environment *(outdoor venue, reverberating hall, etc...)*.
- Compensation of the temperature between the time of measurement and during the show.
- Filter low frequency noises when recording.
- Adapts to lighter CPU via Selection length and Precision controls for faster computation when needed.
- Unit customisation Metric/Imperial and Celsius/Fahrenheit.
- Export the result as Screenshot *(.png)*, Text *(.txt)*, or comma separated file *(.csv)* so you have multiple ways to bring the results with you.
- No need for specific calibration microphone, any reference you have at hand will do for delay computation *(accurate spectrum analysis still requires an adapted microphone)*
