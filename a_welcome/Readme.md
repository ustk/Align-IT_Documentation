## Welcome in Align-IT!

Thank you for choosing Studio 427 Audio.  
Here you will find all the information necessary for measuring the delay time of your venue.


## What is Align-IT?

Align-IT is a measurement tool that will report the delay of your different speakers regarding to a reference.

It is as simple as connecting a microphone, record the different speakers, and wait for Align-IT to compute the resulting delays.

There are many tools on the market for achieving the calibration of a venue. Although, most of the time you only want a quick and affordalble solution for a simple calculation of the delays and a spectogram visualisation. Align-IT it made for you in the situations where time is a key factor.

## What Align-IT proposes:

- Record and compute delay times between speakers.
- Spectral visualisation.
- 3 types of noise generated to adapt to any environment.
- Compensation of the temperature between the time of measurement and during the show.
- Filter low frequency noises when recording.
- Adapts to lighter CPU via Selection length and Precision controls for quicker computation.
- Unit customisation Metric/Customary and Celsius/Fahrenheit.
- Export the result as Screenshot (.png), Text (.txt), or comma separated file (.csv) so you have multiple ways to bring the results with you to the processors.
- No need for specific calibration microphone, any you have at hand will do!
